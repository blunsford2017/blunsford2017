I am a Full Stack Software Developer with a background in medical and accounting. I use my diverse experience and skills in combination with my knowledge in Software Engineering to make communication and understanding between parties clear. My goal is to work on a team with challenging problems that allow me to grow as a professional and give my best to clients. Combining these skills, I will achieve not only my goals, but client and employer goals. I have tech skills in: MERN Stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), Mongoose, HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS 3 (Cascading Style Sheet), JavaScript es6, jQuery, GitHub, Trello, Ruby on Rails, Python, Netlify, and Heroku.

I am currently working on honing my skills I have learned for the past 15 weeks while attending General Assembly's Software Engineering bootcamp, 100 Days of Coding Challenge, my professional portfolio, and more!

I am looking to not only show what I have learned in a new career, but continue learning and growning as a developer.
